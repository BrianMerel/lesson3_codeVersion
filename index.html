            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files
            over time so you can recall specific versions later. This is an alternative to manually creating multiple versions of the same file on a single machine.
            Version control systems present many benefits. They allow for improved collaboration. It allows you to easily share a project with multiple members and view
            the individual contributions of each member. Also it allows the project to be maintained on a central server for all members of the project to access. More importantly
            every member would have a local repository. As a result everything is done locally and changes are pushed to the remote repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is one of the most popular version control systems. It is a free and open source distributed VCS. It works well with
            projects of all sizes. It allows users to create multiple branches and versions of a project. A major benefit is that Git prevents unintentional
            overwrite of a file on a shared repository. This is because the VCS carefully manages changes between the remote repository 
            and local repository of it's members.It is used by popular tech companies
            such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Netflix. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">working with git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To begin with, one has the option of creating or cloning a local repository. To create a new local repository you use '<code>git init</code>'.
            To clone a repository from an existing one you would either checkout a working copy of a local repository or checkout the repository from a remote server.
            Once a local repository is created, the user can manage what files the version control system will track. You use the '<code>git add [file/directory]</code>'.
            You can track specific files and directories or all files, directories, and sub-directories of the local repository. You can then commit changes
            to the local repository using the '<code>git commit -m "some message"</code>'. Finally you would push these changes to the main repository using the
            master branch of your remote repository using '<code>git push origin master</code>'. You can also fetch and merge changes from your remote
            repository to your working directory using '<code>git pull</code>'. There are many more git commands and functionality. You can add versioning, create and manage different
            branches of a project, view merge conflicts, etc. But these are the most commonly used git commands. For more, go to <a href="https://git-scm.com/">their official site</a>.
            Also there are great git repository hosting services such as GitHub and BitBucket. GitHub offers free micro accounts for students so that you may
            have private repositories. BitBucket offers unlimited private repositories for free so long as you have teams of 5 or less.
